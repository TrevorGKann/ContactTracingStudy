Background and Study Summary
</summary>
<p>COVID-19 is an airborne ilness that has already claimed over 6
million lives globally. However, it is not the first pandemic that
humanity has faced and may not be the last. Historically, contact
tracing was used to combat the spread of ilnesses: by determining the
contacts of infected individuals and informing those who may be at risk
of their potential exposure, many infected people can self-isolate
before they show symptoms or become infectious. This was previously done
manually by trained healthcare professionals but this makes the process
resource intensive to scale. The rapid development of the COVID-19
pandemic and its fast spread made manual contact tracing less effective
on slowing the spread of the virus than previous infectious
diseases.</p>
<p>Some researchers have proposed a solution to this problem though, in
the form of automated contact tracing, whereby the prevalence of
cellphones in certain communities is leveraged to help determine
contacts of those who are infected. Many developments have been made in
the field of automated contact tracing, such as making it much more
privacy preserving, battery efficient, and a distributed protocol, but
much work still needs to be done. Specifically, the current application
used in the USA - Exposure Notification - relies off bluetooth low
energy (BLE) signals between devices, which is a notoriously noisy
indicator of distances. Furthermore, few datasets exist of these BLE
signals between devices and none between many people, where contact
tracing would be most effective. Obtaining this data is critical to
studying and accurately benchmarking contact tracing algorithms. The
current best dataset available was made by the NIST’s <a
href="https://tc4tlchallenge.nist.gov/">Too Close for Too Long (TC4TL)
competition</a>, where pairs of people collected BLE data between one
another. This was a useful step but now data is needed between multiple
people to determine the effects of other people or phones in the same
room on BLE signals.</p>
The purpose of this study is to collect such a dataset for our own
contact tracing algorithm studies as well as for other researchers to
evaluate their algorithms.

What Kind of Information We Collect
</summary>
<p>Our app collects data from the following information from your phone
and its sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>phone model</li>
<li>accelerometer</li>
<li>gyroscope</li>
<li>activity</li>
<li>heading</li>
<li>magnetometer</li>
<li>compas</li>
<li>Bluetooth signal strength to other phones running the app</li>
</ul>
This information is stored locally on your device until you complete the
send-off form, at which point it sends it to me anonymously. We do not
believe the information contained from these sensors can be used to
infer sensitive information about you and your name is not linked to
your data.

<summary>
How We Handle Your Information
</summary>
<p>The data you provide us is stored locally on a machine at CMU in a
locked area. The machine it will be retained on is locked with a
password and on an encrypted disk.</p>
We will eventually release the data as a public dataset for future
research.
