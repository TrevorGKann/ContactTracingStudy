Your device will now begin recording data.
You can lock the device and place it in your desired location.

When the study has finished, you may unlock your device and press the "STOP!" button on the app. 
The app will then ask if you want to send the data, please answer yes.
It will prepare and email with the data to be sent to tkann@andrew.cmu.edu, please send the data.
