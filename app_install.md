# App Instalation Guide

First, download the app from [this link](https://github.com/TrevorGKann/ContactTracingStudy/raw/main/CoCoT_App.apk). 
Then, either click the bubble that said it was downloaded or go to the "Files" app on your phone and click on the downloaded APK.
Your phone may ask you to give permissions to install apps downloaded from the internet, temporarily allow this (you should probably set it to off after you install our app).
Select yes, and install the app. 
When you run the app for the first time, it will ask for Bluetooth permissions, please say yes as the app will not function without this permission. 
Your app is installed and ready to go!

## Using the App

We will walk you through this process during the study, but also explain it here.
At the start of the study, please fill out the form the app presents you with.
For the pariticipant ID slot, please use the same number stated on your lanyard. 
Once you have completed the form, press the "START!" button. 
Your device will now begin recording data.
You can lock the device and place it in your desired location.

When the study has finished, you may unlock your device and press the "STOP!" button on the app. 
The app will then ask if you want to send the data, please answer yes.
It will prepare and send the data to a server of ours.

The app does not record sensitive information; it does record redouts from the following sensors: Gyroscope, accelerometer, heading, activity, magnetometer, compas, and Bluetooth.

## Why We Require Permissions

Bluetooth: The goal of the study is to study how Bluetooth low energy (BLE) signals behave between phones in different environments and with different actions.
We require BLE for this reason.
Our app only emits BLE signals with a specific tag, and we only scan for BLE signals with the same tag, no other signals.
Our app does not connect to any other BLE devices, it is not aware of currently/previously connected devices, nor can it access those devices.

Our app does not require any other permissions.
