Todo - android app:
[] - enable all the same sensors as TC4TL
[X] - make sensor latency consistent with TC4TL
[] - filter different MAC addressed via BLE
[] - check if BLE is on and if not request turn on
    [x] Kinda did it. It now doesn't crash, but tells user to turn it on instead.
[x] - stream sensor data to persistent file on device
[] - check log file is similar to TC4TL (might be later)
[x] - make different modes in app: ready, start, stop & upload
    [x] - start
    [x] - stop
    [x] - upload
[] - upload logfile to server
    [] - client side
    [] - server side
